## 🧩 Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge:

Implementing a **star and shooting star background** without affecting performance.

### Solution:

Used the **HTML Canvas API** with `requestAnimationFrame()` for efficient rendering.
Stars were given randomized **position, size, and opacity**. Shooting stars were triggered occasionally by giving certain stars higher velocity and trails.
This created a **natural night sky effect** ✨ while keeping performance smooth.
